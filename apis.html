<p>Designed, built and operated at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland, Parker Solar Probe is operating normally heading into perihelion. Using its four onboard instrument suites, the spacecraft will continue collecting data on the solar environment and solar wind for this encounter through Aug. 15, with much of the data from the encounter expected back on Earth by Aug. 18.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are getting into the critical phase of the Parker mission and we’re focused on quite a few things during this encounter,” said Nour E. Raouafi, Parker Solar Probe project scientist from APL. “We expect the spacecraft to be flying through the acceleration zone of the perpetual flow of charged particles that make up the solar wind. Solar activity is also picking up, which is promising for studying larger-scale solar wind structures, like coronal mass ejections, and the energetic particles associated with them.</p>
<p>“But you never know what else you’ll find exploring this close to the Sun,” he added, “and that&#8217;s always exciting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Three years into its seven-year primary mission, Parker Solar Probe remains healthy while traversing a path that will take it directly through the Sun&#8217;s outer atmosphere, known as the corona. The Thermal Protection System shielding the spacecraft is already facing temperatures above 1,200 degrees Fahrenheit (650 degrees Celsius). At Parker Solar Probe&#8217;s closest approaches, the TPS must withstand temperatures of 2,500 F while keeping the spacecraft and instruments in its shadow operating at about 85 F.</p>
<p>Preparations are underway for the mission’s fifth flyby of Venus, on Oct. 16, which will direct Parker Solar Probe even closer to the Sun for its 10th science orbit, which culminates with its fourth and final perihelion of the year on Nov. 21.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists using data from NASA’s Parker Solar Probe released a new collection of research papers in a special issue of the journal Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics on June 2, 2021.</p>
<p>The issue, titled <a href="https://www.aanda.org/component/toc/?task=topic&amp;id=1326">Parker Solar Probe: Ushering a New Frontier in Space Exploration</a>, includes 37 papers on discoveries made during mission&#8217;s first four orbits around the Sun. The new research builds upon initial results <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2019/nasas-parker-solar-probe-sheds-new-light-on-the-sun">released in Nature</a> in 2019 and a <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/parkersolarprobe/2020/02/05/new-wave-of-parker-solar-probe-science-published/">special supplement</a> of The Astrophysical Journal in 2020.</p>
<p>The latest articles include data analysis, theory, and modeling. Among the major topics covered are magnetic switchbacks first discovered by Parker Solar Probe, the role of waves in heating solar plasma, solar angular momentum, the near-Sun dust environment, and the diversity of small energetic-particle events. Highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul>
<li>The enigma of magnetic switchbacks in the “young” solar wind. The switchbacks are more prominent, and play a larger role in the structure of the solar wind, closer to the Sun. Their origin, evolution and contribution to the heating and acceleration of the solar wind plasma is highly debated. Several papers in this issue discuss different aspects of this mysterious feature.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Clear evidence of the <a href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2021/06/aa39284-20/aa39284-20.html">dust-free zone</a> around the Sun, supporting the initial hints of such a zone published in the 2019 Nature papers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Designed, built, and operated by the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, or APL, in Laurel, Maryland, Parker Solar Probe recently completed its eighth solar encounter, breaking its own records for speed and proximity to the Sun. It will reach its top speed and closest point to our star — coming within 4 million miles of its surface, moving some 430,000 miles per hour — by December 2024. The Parker Solar Probe project is managed by the Heliophysics Division of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>“All of the results we’ve reported so far, since Parker Solar Probe began its mission in August 2018, depict conditions of a ‘quiet’ Sun during the solar minimum, or its least active period,” said Nour Raouafi, the Parker Solar Probe project scientist from APL. “Many more discoveries await us as the Sun becomes more active and as the spacecraft reaches deeper into the Sun’s corona.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NASA&#8217;s Parker Solar Probe executed a small maneuver on May 15, 2021, that corrected the trajectory errors from a gravity-assist flyby of Venus in February — and put the probe on newly optimized path for its next Venus gravity assist on Oct. 16.</p>
<p>The maneuver, monitored from the mission operations center at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, lasted about 39 seconds and tweaked the spacecraft&#8217;s velocity by 91 centimeters per second, or about 2 miles per hour. The difference might seem negligible to a spacecraft zooming around the Sun at 330,000 miles per hour, but it was actually enough to fine-tune Parker Solar Probe’s path toward the next <a href="http://parkersolarprobe.jhuapl.edu/The-Mission/index.php#Journey-to-the-Sun"><em>three</em> Venus gravity assists</a>.</p>

<p>Parker Solar Probe just completed its <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/parkersolarprobe/2021/05/03/successful-eighth-solar-flyby-for-parker-solar-probe/">eighth close approach</a> to the Sun, coming within a record 6.5 million miles (10.4 million kilometers) of the Sun&#8217;s surface on April 29. It&#8217;ll pass the Sun from about the same distance again on Aug. 9, before using Venus&#8217; gravity on Oct. 16 to swing it even closer to the surface — about 5.6 million miles (9 million kilometers) — on Nov. 21. Assisted by the remaining three Venus flybys, Parker Solar Probe will eventually come within 4 million miles (6.4 million kilometers) of the solar surface.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NASA’s Parker Solar Probe has started its eighth science-gathering solar encounter, putting it one-third of the way through its planned journey of 24 progressively closer loops around the Sun.</p>
<p>Its orbit, shaped by a <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/parkersolarprobe/2021/02/19/parker-solar-probe-primed-for-fourth-venus-flyby/">gravity-assist flyby of Venus</a> on Feb. 20, 2021, will bring the spacecraft closer to the Sun than on any previous flyby. At closest approach, called perihelion, on April 29, Parker Solar Probe will come within about 6.5 million miles (10.4 million kilometers) of the Sun’s surface, while moving faster than 330,000 miles per hour (532,000 kilometers per hour) – breaking its own records for both speed and solar proximity.</p>

<p>On April 25, the spacecraft radioed a “tone one” beacon to operators at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, or APL, in Maryland, indicating all systems were normal heading into closest approach. Parker Solar Probe’s four onboard instrument suites are now collecting data on the solar environment and the solar wind as it streams from the Sun, and science data collection will continue through May 4.</p>
<p>Other ground- and space-based observatories will also capture measurements during this solar encounter in coordination with Parker Solar Probe, including a <a href="http://sdoisgo.blogspot.com/2021/04/sdo-off-point-during-parker-solar-probe.html">special observing campaign</a> by NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NASA’s Parker Solar Probe speeds past Venus on Feb. 20, 2021, using the planet’s gravity to shape its path for its next close approaches to the Sun.</p>
<p>At just after 3:05 p.m. EST, moving about 54,000 miles per hour (about 86,900 kilometers per hour)<em>,</em> the spacecraft will pass 1,482 miles (2,385 kilometers) above Venus’ surface as it curves around the planet. Such Venus gravity assists are essential to the mission to bring the spacecraft close to the Sun; Parker Solar Probe relies on the planet to reduce its orbital energy, which in turn allows it to travel closer to the Sun – and inspect the properties of the solar wind closer to its source.</p>

<p>This is the fourth of seven planned Venus gravity assists, and will set Parker Solar Probe up for its eighth and ninth close passes by the Sun, slated for April 29 and Aug. 9.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There are lots of eyes on the Sun this week, as NASA’s Parker Solar Probe swings around our star on the seventh of its 24 scheduled orbits.</p>
<p>None are closer than Parker Solar Probe, which passed just 8.4 million miles (13.5 million kilometers) from the Sun’s surface while flying at 289,932 miles per hour (466,600 kilometers per hour) on Jan. 17, essentially matching its <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/parkersolarprobe/2020/09/30/parker-solar-probe-phones-home-after-sixth-sun-flyby/">own records</a> for solar proximity and speed. Around this same time, several spacecraft and dozens of earthbound telescopes were primed to contribute observations that will give scientists a comprehensive and coordinated picture of solar activity.</p>
<p>On Jan. 21, the spacecraft transmitted a “tone one,” indicating all systems were healthy and operating normally after the spacecraft’s close approach to the Sun and heading into the final stretch of the solar encounter, which runs through Jan. 23.</p>
<p>The geometry of this particular orbit means that Parker Solar Probe’s closest approach to the Sun, or perihelion, was in direct view of Earth. Some 40 observatories around the globe, including major installations in Hawaii, the southwestern United States, Europe, and Asia, trained their telescopes on the Sun over the several weeks around the perihelion. About a dozen spacecraft, including NASA’s STEREO, Solar Dynamics Observatory, TIMED, and Magnetospheric Multiscale missions, ESA and NASA’s Solar Orbiter, and ESA’s BepiColombo made simultaneous observations of activity stretching from the Sun to Earth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Parker Solar Probe has shown us that there is a lot more interconnected activity near the Sun than we once thought,&#8221; said Parker Solar Probe Project Scientist Nour Raouafi of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab, or APL, in Laurel, Maryland. &#8220;With this closest approach visible from Earth, we have a fantastic opportunity to put as many eyes as we can on the Sun to help us build a big picture. And we really appreciate the enthusiastic cooperation of so many observatory and mission teams to make that happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now just over two years into its seven-year mission, the Parker Solar Probe spacecraft will eventually travel within 4 million miles of the Sun&#8217;s surface. The mission’s primary goal is to provide new data on solar activity and the workings of the Sun’s outer atmosphere – the corona – which contributes significantly to our ability to forecast major space weather events that impact life on Earth.</p>
<p>The spacecraft will make three more progressively close passes to the Sun in 2021 alone, as well as two gravity-assist flybys at Venus in February and October to adjust the trajectory of its orbit. After zipping past Venus on Feb. 20, Parker Solar Probe will again make close approaches to the Sun on April 29 and Aug. 9. Following another Venus gravity assist on Oct. 16, the spacecraft will make an even closer solar pass on Nov. 21, with perihelion just 5.3 million miles from the Sun’s surface.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is our busiest year since launch, and it only gets busier as our trajectory takes us closer and closer to the Sun,&#8221; said Parker Solar Probe Project Manager Helene Winters of APL. &#8220;This is exactly what the spacecraft was designed for – it’s operating just as we expected and is giving us even more data than anticipated. We’re ready for a range of discoveries in this unexplored region of the Sun.&#8221;</p>

<p>In September, Parker Solar Probe completed its sixth solar encounter. Data from this sixth encounter will be released in February 2021, and early review by the science team has already revealed the mission’s <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2020/two-views-of-a-sungrazing-comet/">first observation</a> of a sungrazing comet.</p>
<p>Next year will be record-setting for Parker Solar Probe. Starting in January, the spacecraft, built and operated by the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, will embark on four solar encounters and two Venus flybys throughout 2021. The spacecraft will travel even closer toward the Sun’s blazing atmosphere, capturing unprecedented data on solar activity and breaking its own speed and distance records multiple times in the process. </p>
<p>Parker Solar Probe’s next solar encounter — on Jan. 12-23, 2021 — will carry the spacecraft around the Earth-facing side of the Sun, providing an opportunity for joint observations with multiple ground-based observatories and several space missions. The coordinated observation campaign organized by the mission’s science team will include NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory and STEREO spacecraft, ESA’s BepiColombo, and ESA and NASA’s Solar Orbiter and SOHO missions.</p>
